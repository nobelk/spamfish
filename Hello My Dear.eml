Hello My Dear,

My Name is Mrs. Maria Crasmaru, from Romania. I know that this message will
be a surprise to you. Firstly, I am married to Mr. Patrick Crasmaru, A gold
merchant who owns a small gold Mine in Austria, He died of cardiovascular
disease in mid-March 2018. During his lifetime he deposited the sum of (=E2=
=82=AC
8.500,000 Million Euro) Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand Euros in a
bank in Vienna, the capital city of Austria in Europe. The deposited money
was from the sale of the shares, death benefits payment and entitlements of
my deceased husband by his company.

I have decided to donate what i have to you for the support of helping
Motherless babies/Less privileged/Widows because I am dying and diagnosed
with cancer about 2 years ago, I have been touched by God Almighty to
donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you for the good
work of God Almighty. I have asked Almighty God to forgive me and believe
he has, because He is a Merciful God, I will be going in for a surgery soon=
.

I am sending this message to you praying that it will reach you in good
health, since I am not in good health in which I sleep every night without
knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am suffering from long
term cancer and presently I am partially suffering from a stroke illness
which has become almost impossible for me to move around.

I was married to my late husband for over 4 years before he died and
unfortunately that we don't have a child, my doctor confided in me that i
have less chance to live. Having known my health condition, I decided to
contact you to claim the fund since I don't have any relatives, I grew up
in an orphanage home.

This is the reason I need your services to stand as my next of kin or an
executor to claim the funds for charity purposes. If this money remains
unclaimed after my death, the bank executives or the government will take
the money as unclaimed fund and maybe use it for selfish and worthless
ventures, I need a very honest person who can claim this money and use it
for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also build schools for less
privilege that will be named after my late husband and my name; I need your
urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this project, and I
will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your
bank account.

Thanks
Mrs. Maria Crasmaru.
